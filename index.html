<font face= "comic sans MS" color="yellow"><p>How did the common people react to Nazism? Many saw the 
world through Nazi eyes, and spoke their mind in Nazi language. They felt hatred and anger surge inside 
them when they saw someone who looked like a Jew. They marked the houses of Jews and reported suspicious 
neighbours. They genuinely believed Nazism would bring prosperity  and improve general well-being.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="yellow"><p>But not every German was a Nazi. Many organised active 
resistance to Nazism, braving police repression and death. The large majority of Germans, however, 
were passive onlookers and apathetic witnesses. They were too scared to act, to differ, to protest. 
They preferred to look  away. Pastor Niemoeller, a resistance fighter, observed an absence of protest, 
an uncanny silence, amongst ordinary Germans in the face of brutal and organised crimes committed against 
people in the Nazi empire. He wrote movingly about this silence:</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="yellow">‘First they came for the Communists,<br> 
Well, I was not a Communist-<br> 
So I said nothing.<br> 
Then they came for the Social Democrats,<br> 
Well, I was not a Social Democrat<br> 
So I did nothing,<br> 
Then they came for the trade unionists,<br> 
But I was not a trade unionist.<br> 
And then they came for the Jews,<br> 
But I was not a Jew - so I did little.<br> 
Then when they came for me,<br> 
There was no one left who could stand up for me.’</font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="yellow"><p>What Jews felt in Nazi Germany is a different story altogether. 
Charlotte Beradt secretly recorded peoples dreams in her diary and later published them in a highly disconcerting 
book called the Third Reich of Dreams. She describes how Jews themselves began believing in the Nazi stereotypes 
about them. They dreamt of their hooked noses, black hair and eyes, Jewish looks and body movements. The stereotypical 
images publicised in the Nazi press haunted the Jews. They troubled them even in their dreams. Jews died many deaths 
even before they reached the gas chamber.</p></font><br><br>
<font color="red"><i><u><h2> Knowledge about the Holocaust </h2></u></i></font><br>
<image src="9.jpg" height=250 width=350 align=left> 
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="yellow"><p>Information about Nazi practices had trickled out of Germany during the 
last years of the regime. But it was only after the war ended and Germany was defeated that the world came to realise 
the horrors of what had happened. While the Germans were preoccupied with their own plight as a defeated nation emerging 
out of the rubble, the Jews wanted the world to remember the atrocities and sufferings they had endured during the Nazi 
killing operations  also called the Holocaust. At its height, a ghetto inhabitant had said to another that he wanted to 
outlive the war just for half an hour. Presumably he meant that he wanted to be able to tell the world about what had 
happened in Nazi Germany. This indomitable spirit to bear witness and to preserve the documents can be seen in many ghetto 
and camp inhabitants who wrote diaries, kept notebooks, and created archives. On the other hand when the war seemed lost, 
the Nazi leadership distributed petrol to its functionaries to destroy all incriminating evidence available in offices.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="yellow"><p>Yet the history and the memory of the Holocaust live on in memoirs, fiction, 
documentaries, poetry, memorials and museums in many parts of the world today. These are a tribute to those who resisted 
it, an embarrassing reminder to those who collaborated, and a warning to those who watched in silence.</p></font><br>
